Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##My tests

```{r}
x <- 4
height_ft <- c(2.3, 4.5, 3)

coef <- 3.4
```

# Introduction

## About the data

-   Water sample data from rctic Ocean
-   Downloaded from Arctic data center: [Tweedie ADC dataset](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)

## Setup

Message: false makes infotext disappear

```{r}
#| message: false

library(readr)
library(here)
```

## Read in data

Quarto assumes that our folder where the quarto script is is the wd, so we use the here function, which makes it start again from the main project directory. warning: false disables the display of the warning

```{r}
#| warning: false

bg_chem <- read_csv(here::here("data/BGchem2008data.csv")) #read_csv is better at handling dates and other dataformats than read.csv

```

# Analysis

## Calc summary stats

Do some data exploration

```{r}
colnames(bg_chem)
str(bg_chem)
head(bg_chem)
summary(bg_chem)
unique(bg_chem$Date)


```

## Calc mean Redfield ratio

Something to do with the ocean

```{r}
# calculate means
nitrate <- mean(bg_chem$NO3)
nitrite <- mean(bg_chem$NO2)
amm <- mean(bg_chem$NH4)
phos <- mean(bg_chem$P)

#calc ratio 
ratio <- (nitrate + nitrite + amm)/phos

```

You can reference a variable or an item in the markdown section: Here is the ratio we calculated: `r ratio` and rounded `r round(ratio)`
Kindof like an in-line codechunk, so the quotation marks tell it to run the bit in marks as code.

## Plot Redfield ratio

```{r}
plot(bg_chem$P, bg_chem$NO3+bg_chem$NO2+bg_chem$NH4)
```

## Quarto and the R environment

running all or dowm to everything is cool, but if nothing is run and you render, the html will still do everything it should including calculations.

## Why is this markdown helpful

Its generally good for sharing because it is easier to read for humans, could be hosted on a website, etc. Literate analysis is really helpful for communication in collaborations. You can easily create a webiste in github that will render your quarto documents. Also good for reports, because you can generate a pdf from it, you could just change some things about it in the code every year.
Lastly, you can integrate the code with your paper for reproducible papers.
